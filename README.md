# **craigsList_scraping**
 ### A web scraping project. Scraps data from Craigslist website.
#
For this project we need to install **Scrapy**, a web scraping framework written in python.

*To install Scrapy:*
```
pip install scrapy
```
#

#### Typically any Scrapy command will look like this:
```
scrapy <command> [options] [args]
```

### Creating a Scrapy Project

Now, we need to create a Scrapy project.
The command is:  `scrapy startproject 'projectName'`

*Let's do ours:*
```
scrapy startproject craigslist
```
